# STAT3009-2022 Project2

This is the notebook for Kaggle Competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cuhkstat3009-p2 in course STAT3009 Recommendation System. In this project, we were required to design and build a recommendation system model with algorithms learned in the course to predict users' ratings for musics. 

You can take this notebook as a reference. If you are a student in The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I highly recommend you to attend STAT30009 Recommendation System to learn more!
